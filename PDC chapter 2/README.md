define the concepts of thread-based and multithreaded programming and then
introduce the multithreading library. We will learn about the main directives for thread
definition, management, and communication.
Through the multithreading library, we will see how to solve problems through different
techniques, such as lock, RLock, semaphores, condition, event, barrier, and queue.
